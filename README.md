# 🚀 JP' Portfolio Site

Welcome to my personal portfolio built during the MLH Fellowship! 🌟 This site was created using Flask as the foundation to showcase my work experience, education, hobbies, and the amazing places I’ve visited. It’s designed to reflect my personality, skills, and adventures.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 📌 GitHub Tasks
- ✔️ Created Issues for each task.
- ✔️ Worked on each task in a new branch.
- ✔️ Opened Pull Requests and received feedback before merging.

### 🌐 Portfolio Tasks
- ✔️ Added a photo of myself to the website.
- ✔️ Included an "About Myself" section.
- ✔️ Added my previous work experiences.
- ✔️ Showcased my hobbies (with images!).
- ✔️ Added my current and previous education.
- ✔️ Implemented an interactive map of the countries/locations I’ve visited.

### 🐍 Flask Tasks
- ✔️ Got the Flask app running locally on my machine.
- ✔️ Used Jinja templates to dynamically display multiple work experiences, education, and hobbies.
- ✔️ Created a new page to display hobbies.
- ✔️ Added a dynamic navigation bar that links all pages in the app.

## 🚦 Getting Started

🔹 This project was built from a template provided by MLH. I’ve already forked and customized it to make it unique and representative of myself.

🔹 The site is deployed and live on a server — check it out here!

## Installation

Make sure you have python3 and pip installed

Create and activate virtual environment using virtualenv
```bash
$ python -m venv python3-virtualenv
$ source python3-virtualenv/bin/activate
```

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install all dependencies!

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Create a .env file using the example.env template (make a copy using the variables inside of the template)

Start flask development server
```bash
$ export FLASK_ENV=development
$ flask run
```

You should get a response like this in the terminal:
```
❯ flask run
 * Environment: development
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

You'll now be able to access the website at `localhost:5000` or `127.0.0.1:5000` in the browser! 

*Note: The portfolio site will only work on your local machine while you have it running inside of your terminal. We'll go through how to host it in the cloud in the next few weeks!*
